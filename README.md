Hrnet (Front End part) for Project 14 of OpenClassRooms Front-End Dev courses. The objective was to turn an old JQuery website into a full react app. In this project I wanted to have a little bit of fun and improve my skills with different libraries like React Data Table Component or React Datepicker for example. So this project have few dependencies to install.
